This database file can be encrypted on disk. This prevents attackers from reading the secret keys even if they manage to steal the wallet file.</p><p>Zkool allows creating and using different databases, each with their own optional password.</p><h2 id="synchronization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#synchronization"><span>Synchronization</span></a></h2><p>The synchronization algorithm is an improved version of the Warp Sync used in Ywallet. The new version is faster and uses less memory. It can also keep each account synchronization data separated.</p><h2 id="mempool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mempool"><span>Mempool</span></a></h2><p>Zkool monitors the mempool and can recognize incoming and outgoing transactions that are not yet included in a block.
