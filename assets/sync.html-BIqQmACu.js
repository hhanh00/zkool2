If you mispell a word, it will be invalid. Unfortunately, there is no error correction. The app knows there is an error somewhere but cannot help you correct the mistake. Make sure you write down the seed phrase exactly as shown.</p><blockquote><p>The <em>address index</em> could be wrong.</p></blockquote><p>If you are sure you have the right seed phrase but still see no funds, it may be because you do not have the right <em>account index</em>. Account indices start at 0. If your original wallet had multiple accounts, it could have used an index different than 0.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>ZECWallet Lite uses account indices when you generate additional shielded addresses.</p></div><p>Accounts that have the same address have the same key (and therefore the same balance). <em>However accounts that have different addresses may also have the same key</em> (using different diversified addresses or different receivers of the UA).

In this case, you need to scan for these transparent addresses too. On the address page, tap the &quot;Scan Transparent Addresses&quot; button and wait for the scan to finish. Then go to the account edit page to reset the synchronization data and resync.</p><figure><img src="'+c+'" alt="Scan Transparent Addresses" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Scan Transparent Addresses</figcaption></figure><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>Scanning takes a while.

Zkool does not mark notes as spent until it sees them used in a block. In particular, making a tx does not mark the notes as spent until it is mined.</p><blockquote><p>How do I make multiple tx in a row? After the first one, the server reports a double spend.</p></blockquote><p>The easiest way is to batch the payments into a single transaction. You&#39;d pay less and it&#39;d be faster. Note that it also links the payments since they are likely made by the same person. If your tx involves transparent inputs/outputs it could be an issue.</p><p>If you don&#39;t want to wait or do a multi recipient transaction, you can manually exclude the notes from further spending in the note tab. That&#39;s rather tedious.</p><figure><img src="'+h+'" alt="Notes" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Notes</figcaption></figure><p>Notes in gray are excluded.

It could be because you have accidentally submitted it twice. Just ignore the error.</p><h2 id="transaction-not-mined" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#transaction-not-mined"><span>Transaction not mined</span></a></h2><blockquote><p>A transaction was sent successfully and you have a tx id but it is not mined after a long time like 10 minutes. When you look at the mempool on a block explorer, you notice that your transaction is not there.</p></blockquote><p>Your transaction is somehow incorrect but not properly rejected by the server node. It is an issue with the server consensus so there is nothing much you can do at the wallet level besides retrying. If the same thing happens again, try using another server running a different node software.</p><h2 id="bad-anchor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bad-anchor"><span>Bad Anchor</span></a></h2><blockquote><p>When you prepare the transaction, Zkool returns an error related to a &quot;bad anchor&quot;.</p></blockquote><p>This is also probably related to an issue at the server where in case of a block reorganization, it returns the older fork. Unfortunately, the bug hasn&#39;t been identified because of its rarity but it seems to affect all wallet software. Fortunately, you can fix the issue by rewinding the account to an earlier checkpoint in the Edit page.</p><figure><img src="'+l+'" alt="Rewind Checkpoint" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Rewind Checkpoint</figcaption></figure><h2 id="too-slow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#too-slow"><span>Too Slow</span></a></h2><p>Between block 1.7m and 2.1m, there has been a spike in the number of transactions that filled up every block. It represents close to a 100x increase in data to process. Consequently, synchronization will slow down significantly during that range.</p><blockquote><p>If your wallet was created after block 2.2m, I <em>highly</em> encourage you to provide a birth height. You do not want to be processing the &quot;spam&quot; blocks if you can avoid it.</p></blockquote><p>You could try tweaking the setting &quot;Actions Per Sync&quot;. It is the size of the batch of blocks that we process concurrently before writing a checkpoint to the database. A high number requires more memory and checkpoints spaced farther apart, but can improve the synchronization process on powerful computers.</p>',51)]))}const y=t(u,[["render",d]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/recipe/sync.html","title":"Troubleshooting Synchronization Issues","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Troubleshooting Synchronization Issues"},"git":{"updatedTime":1760687103000,"contributors":[{"name":"Hanh Huynh Huu","username":"","email":"hanh425@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"36500f928db2d741ad68d5704471e127001f7b6b","time":1760687103000,"email":"hanh425@gmail.com","author":"Hanh Huynh Huu","message":"iso doc"}]},"filePathRelative":"recipe/sync.md"}');export{y as comp,m as data};
