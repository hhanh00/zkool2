In a cryptocurrency, it is most of the time the association between an <em>address</em> and a <em>value</em>, which represents the &quot;balance&quot; of an &quot;account&quot;.</p><ul><li>Account --&gt; Address</li><li>Balance --&gt; Value</li></ul><p>We say that the system reaches consensus when there is a undisputed and unambigious state that participants of system agree on.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>This is harder to achieve than it seems, especially in distributed systems.</p></div><h2 id="initial-state-and-blockchain" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#initial-state-and-blockchain"><span>Initial State and Blockchain</span></a></h2><p>At the beginning, the system starts with a predetermined state. Usually, it is the state where every account has zero balance<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1"></a></sup>.</p><p>Then as <em>transactions</em> are performed and recorded in the <em>Blockchain</em>, the state evolves.</p><div class="hint-container important"><p class="hint-container-title">Important</p><p>To maintain <em>consensus</em>, the <em>effects</em> and the <em>order</em> of the transactions must be <strong>deterministic</strong>.</p></div><h2 id="centralized-vs-decentralized" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#centralized-vs-decentralized"><span>Centralized vs Decentralized</span></a></h2><p>A system is centralized when all the transactions must go through a single authority. Effectively, there is a <strong>boss</strong>. Everyone must report to them and nothing can change the State unless it has been checked and authorized by the boss.</p><p>The banking system follows the centralized model. Customers interact via Online Banking, Vendor Terminals, Retail Agents, etc. who will consult with the Bank Account Database before authorizing the operation<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote2">[2]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref2"></a></sup>.</p><p>The alternative is a <strong>decentralized</strong> system where no single authority is in charge of the system. Instead, consensus is reached when it can be established that &quot;enough&quot; participants agree and that the state is correct and unambiguous.</p><p>Correctness is the &quot;easier&quot; part. Unless there are bugs in the software, the state remains correct (by induction) if it started correct and <em>every transaction</em> is also correct.</p><p>But, there could be multiple correct states if the participants use different (valid) transactions.</p><p>We are not going to get into the details of how consensus is determined. It is <em>difficult</em> and <em>varies between types of Blockchains</em>.</p><h2 id="public-vs-private" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#public-vs-private"><span>Public vs Private</span></a></h2><p>Most cryptocurrencies are anonymous but not private. Users do not register with a central authority in order to create an account (or an address) but it is possible, and fairly easy, to get the transaction history of any address. With a bit of effort, the transaction between addresses can be plotted and analyzed, giving valuable insights into someone&#39;s spending.</p><p>When external information is added, for example the KYC (Know Your Customer) data collected by the crypto exchanges, one can further identify the transaction details.</p><p>Private cryptocurrencies aim to eliminate (or at least reduce) the amount of identifiable information.</p><p>Ideally, a private system would be such that only the people involved in a transaction know that it took place. The recipients receive their funds but does not know where they came from.</p><p>In real life, a cash transaction achieves that<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote3">[3]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref3"></a></sup>. But in the digital world, it is <strong>extremely difficult</strong>.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p><strong>No cryptocurrency is perfectly private</strong> unlike what they sometimes claim. It is always the responsibility of the user to know what information is made available to third parties. Also, users should be aware that there are <em>tradeoffs</em> between <strong>usability</strong> and <strong>privacy</strong>.</p></div><p>Unfortunately, many users overlook this aspect and demand that their private coin behaves as well as public coins. Progress can and will be made, but there are limitations that are very unlikely to disappear<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote4">[4]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref4"></a></sup>.</p><p>The goal of this documentation is to give you the required insights into the ZK (Zero Knowledge) based privacy coins to make educated decisions.</p><h2 id="pools-and-transactions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pools-and-transactions"><span>Pools and Transactions</span></a></h2><h2 id="local-vs-global-state" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#local-vs-global-state"><span>Local vs Global State</span></a></h2><p>--</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="footnote1" class="footnote-item"><p>Some cryptocurrencies start with funds in a set of predetermined addresses.
