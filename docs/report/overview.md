## Overview

To track the incomes and expenses, you need to assign a category to
your transactions[^1].

::: important
Reports are valued in **USD** (and not in ZEC).
:::

Therefore you also need to have the price of 1 ZEC at the time of
the transaction.

If you initiated the transaction and entered the price of ZEC in the "Send"
form. When you receive ZEC, the transaction has "N/A" price. It should be edited
in the transaction details page.

## Fetching Tx Prices

For convenience, the market prices can be retrieved from CoinGecko for the
current year[^2].

[^1]: Transactions that don't have a category are excluded from the reports.
[^2]: CoinGecko has older data but getting more than the current year requires a
    commercial license.
