## Networks
By default, Zkool connects to Mainnet.

To make it work as a testnet wallet, use a database name that contains `testnet`. For
Regtest, include the word `regtest`.

You must also make sure you connect to a server of the corresponding network.

For instance, for testnet you can use `https://testnet.zec.rocks`.
