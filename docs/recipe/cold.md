title: Cold Wallet
---

> A Cold Wallet is a wallet that has secret keys but remains disconnected from the
Internet **at all times**.

It is not sufficient to be disconnected *most of the time*. For instance, a
wallet on a phone that it is turned on only when making transactions is NOT a
cold wallet.
